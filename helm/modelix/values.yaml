  # The internal docker registry does not use HTTPS.

  # Therefore, the internal docker registry is exposed through NodePort on each cluster node.
  # The node port on which it is exposed needs
  # to be known in advance because we need to specify the address for authentication.
  # The node port is configurable to allow
  # changing it in deployments where it conflicts with other statically assigned node ports.
